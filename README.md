# InstaAdmin Landing Page

## Developers

The plugin works by creating a hidden post type and allowing you to edit one post in the block editor.

This post will be what is shown on the admin landing page.

The admin landing page uses a theme.json file, which dictates the admin appearance.

For appearance, the focus is on core blocks and compatibility with two layout block suites: GenerateBlocks and Kadence Blocks.

Landing page sidebar code is in: `./src/plugins/landing/index.js`

Block Editor CSS: `./src/scss/admin-block-editor.scss`

Landing Page CSS: `./src/scss/admin-landing.scss`

Theme.json for the admin landing page: `./assets/json/theme.json`.
